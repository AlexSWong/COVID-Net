## COVID-Net Open Initiative

Launched in March in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, COVID-Net is a global open source, open access initiative dedicated to accelerating advancement in machine learning to aid front-line healthcare workers and clinical institutions around the world fighting the continuing pandemic.  Towards this goal, our global multi-disciplinary team of researchers, developers, and clinicians have made publicly available a suite of tailored deep neural network models for tackling different challenges ranging from screening to risk stratification to treatment planning for patients with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).  Furthermore, we have made available fully curated, open access benchmark datasets comprised of some of the largest, most diverse patient cohorts from around the world.  We hope the open-source, open-access release of COVID-Net deep learning models and associated large-scale benchmark datasets will motivate and enable researchers, clinicians, and citizen data scientists alike from around the world to build upon them and accelerate progress in this field.
